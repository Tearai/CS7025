            <p>This is a Roblox game that I have made over the span of 1 weekend. I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new game engine and programming language and I have always played Roblox as a kid so I said why not.</p>
            <p>It was quite challenging to first get into the Roblox game engine as I was used to Unity but eventually got the hang of things.</p>
            <p>Learning a new language Lua was not as challenging but making the script work for the client only took a bit of figuring it out to do but I got it in the end.</p>
            <p>Overall I am pretty happy that I took on this challenge as it has taught me how to make games on Roblox now and how to script only for the client or the server.</p>
            <p><b>Genre:</b> Obby</p>
            <p><b>Engine:</b> Roblox</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> This is a challenging obby game with 50 unique levels. Each stage gets harder as you progress and the gameplay mechanic is different at every stage.</p>
