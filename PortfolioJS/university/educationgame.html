            <p><b>Description:</b>For our third year we have to make a video game with a charity. We had to communicate with the charity to discuss what their vision of a video game would be. They wanted us to create a hub world and have many different mini games for the player.</p>
            <p><b>What I contributed:</b>I was tasked to design 8 different mini game with 2 of my teammates and had to program the player movement and 4 out of the 8 mini games. I have also designed the hub level layout to make sure it resembles the main street of Dublin.</p>
